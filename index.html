            <p>Here the candidate is predisposed in achieving higher career milestones such as growth in annual package, 
              overseas projects etc, through learning new skills or even diversifying their profile.</p>
            <p>The process varies depending on the country one applies to. Select the country you’d like to know about:-</p>
            <!-- <p>Here the candidate is solely interested in either diversifying their career profile or achieving a higher
              tier in their current profile. Industrial oriented prerequisites should be thus kept in mind to achieve
              said target. Master programs like M. Engg are opted by such individuals which are the same as M.Sc
              (theoretical and academic) but there are few compulsory courses specific to management and industrial
              operation.</p>
            <p>One can opt in either M. Engg or M. Sc but it’s good to know the difference between the two and have some
              clarity.</p>
            <p> Here are some details regarding that:</p>
            <div class="steps">
              <h4>Focus more on landing good internships.</h4>
              <p>These are usually scored by personal favors from contacts in industry. People suggest using LinkedIn,
                but rarely it helps, and it also feels a huge waste of time when it doesn’t work.</p>
              <h4>Diversify your profile</h4>
              <p>When you’re industrial oriented, it is important to have skills in multiple fields. Opt for internships
                in companies who cater to different types of problems or clients. During the course of internship, try
                to get into a project. Even if it isn’t official, try to make some valuable contribution in the firm
                during your stay there.</p>
              <h4>Contributions are important!</h4>
              <p>This is important because at interviews, the hiring side is greatly interested in what you have done
                with the skills you acquired in U.G and P.G as compared to what skills you acquired in U.G and P.G. It’s
                kind of obvious when you read it but not so much when you’re living through it.</p>
              <h4>The more applicative your resume lights, the more interviews you can crack</h4>
              <p>Discuss with employees of companies. What did they do to get here? What do they do in their weekly
                working hours? What responsibilities they had in the beginning and what they have right now? You’ll
                figure out a pattern which will be subjective to certain types of companies and get an idea of what all
                you need to do in the coming time.</p>

            <div class="pathways">
              <h4>Universities</h4>
              <p>Research and Career oriented pathways are mutually exclusive only after realizing which one you are
                on, one should plan ahead.</p>
              <p>Below are some of the listed universities (country wise) fitting for this profile:</p> -->
