<p>The master’s degree in UK is usually a two semester’s program. In most of the degrees, a minimum criteria of 30 credits is required to complete your program. Most of the universities DO NOT require GRE for application process. They are primarily concerned with CGPA, work experience and require a minimum IELTS score.</p>
<p>Admission process for fall begins in January of that year and for many of them is on Rolling basis. You apply, they check in next four to ten days, if they like, they admit you then and there. Quite easy tbh.</p>

<p>3.	GRE and IELTS</p>
<p>GRE preparation timeline is highly subjective. Still here’s a brief dissection of the preparation process. It can be cleared in 4 months or even less 
    if studied dedicatedly for. Some people may even require 6 or more months depending on their retaining capacity. </p>
<p>There are ONLY two parts. English. Mathematics. </p>
<p>Paper Pattern:-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Writing (1hour)</li>
<li>Verbal Reasoning (30 minutes)</li><li>Quantitative Reasoning (35 minutes)</li>
<li>Verbal Reasoning (30 minutes)</li>
<li>Quantitative Reasoning (35 minutes)</li>
<li>Verbal/Quantitative (30/35 minutes)</li>
                    </ul>
 <p>Out of the last 5 sections, 4 are fixed. Remaining one can be either Quant or Verbal and this is not scored. 
                        However there is no way of knowing whether the 2nd or 3rd of 4th or 5th or 6th section is the special one. 
                        In personal experience of many candidates, it will be either extremely easy or extremely difficult, but this is 
                        not always true. So it is important to approach each section with EQUAL vigor and attention. </p>
