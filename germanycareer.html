<p>Most of the government funded universities have no tuition fees and students only have to bother about living expenses 
    (ranging from 8 to 9 lakhs per year) in terms of financial obligation. </p>

<p>There are two mediums of language namely German and English for master’s program in Germany. The application requirement 
    and the selection criteria is highly subjective to particular department in the particular university. So it is very important

<p>In Germany, very few universities and programs require GRE. But those who do are majorly concerned with your score in QUANTITATIVE. 
    If GRE is a requirement, make sure to score above 160 at the least. A score above 165 is considered good and those upto 168 and above 
    gives 90 to 95% chance of clearing admission requirement. For Verbal, score above 150 or 155 is appreciable (but do verify once from admission requirements page)</p>
