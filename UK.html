    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The master’s degree in UK is usually a two semester’s program. In most of the degrees, minimum criteria of 30
      credits is required to complete your program. Most of the universities DO NOT require GRE for application process.
      They are primarily concerned with CGPA, work experience and require a minimum IELTS score.</p>
    <p>Admission process for fall begins in January of that year and for many of them is on rolling basis. You apply,
      they check in the next four to ten days, if they like, they admit you then and there. Quite easy to be honest.</p>
    <p>Following is an overview, listing prerequisites of the entire application process for universities in United Kingdom</p>

      This can be achieved in multiple ways and has a specific timeline (mentioned
      in blue) <p>a. The first step is to figure out your area of interest. It may
        be a topic within the department you belong or maybe even outside. (Begin
        by June of 5th Semester) For example, considering a student from
        Mechanical Engineering department, there are numerous subjects like
        thermodynamics, heat transfer, CFD, manufacturing, material science,
        automobile etc</p>
      <p> b. You need to figure out which of these subjects interests
        you the most. Say, Automobile. Now even this topic has endless
        sub-sections like IC engine, powertrain, electric vehicles, material
        science, design of components, heat transfer, autonomous driving, battery
        etc. It is important to have an overall idea about each of these topics.
        (complete by mid-November)</p>
      <p> c. Second step is to choose what exactly you’d
        like to pursue in your master’s program. This decision can be made using a
        variety of parameters, each having an individual priority level. (Complete by
        December end)
      <p>i. Personal Interest:- This is generally governed by the
        people one is surrounded with during 12th and U.G. People are usually
        aware about topics, only up to the extent their friends and family are
        aware. At this stage you can figure out what exactly your AOI (area of
        interest) is through at least a month of self-introspection. (minimum a
        month)</p>
      <p> ii. Scope of development:- If you’re willing to spend 50 to 60
        lakhs in US for M.Sc or 20-30 Lakhs in Germany/U.K, it is crucial that you
        land a high paying job at its end. This severely depend on the subjects
        you choose, which aim at the particular job market in that country. The
        companies need to sponsor your visa, and if you know stuff which is the same
        as their own citizen, it’s difficult to compete with them. So it’s very
        important you enter a field which is new, developing and have a great
        demand to land that mouth drooling high salaried job. For instance, people
        from Tech backgrounds land a job much easily due to high demand as
        compared to those from manufacturing backgrounds.</p>
      </p>
      <p>d. Third Step is to
        approach a professor in your institute who is active in this field. The
        early you approach, the better. Approach can be made as a group, however
        singular is preferable as it gives more freedom in pursuing different
        topics. (complete by mid to end Jan of 6th Semester) </p>
      <p></p>e. 9 out of 10 times
      the professor won’t have much idea about the topic you chose but is only
      remotely related to the “subject”. That’s okay. You need not change your
      goals according to the availability of resources (that comes later XD).
      All you need to do is convince him to work under you and simply guide you
      in terms of set progress and connect you with appropriate people working
      on the same topic.</p>
      <p> f. Fourth step is to begin your project. This means
        start talking to people. Call everyone and anyone you know or have contact
        of working on the same topic as yours. This will give you an idea what
        you’ll be getting yourself into. This will also let you know the numerous
        resources you should access that shall help you in developing the skills
        necessary for your research project. (complete by Feb end)</p>
      <p> g. As you gain
        knowledge, usually by reading journals and books of you AOI, start making
        a report. List down names of important topics, made assumptions and
        derived conclusions. Now comes the best part. Knowing what exactly you’re
        “supposed” to do with this.</p>
      <p> h. The aim, the ultimate aim, is to find a
        problem statement. Finding the PS is 60% of your job. Solving it is next
        30% and publishing it is remaining 10. How to find problem statement </p>
      <p>I.
        List down all the assumptions. Now alter one of them, and see how the
        results deflect. Now see how this assumption can be changed from ideal to
        real situation and in what way the model should be changed to give results
        for this real situation. This is one of the most difficult task to
        achieve, but can be done in steps and partial efficiency.</p>
      <p> II. List down
        all the conclusions. Many of them will be subjective to specific
        parameters, surrounding conditions and theorems. You can simply alter
        these parameters and derive results for your choice of control condition.
        This is one of the easiest way of achieving results but also done by many.
        So the main thing is to dig into a topic where few people have reached so
        far. And dig in quick.</p>
      <p> i. The Fifth step is to get an idea of what is the
        current technological situation in this topic. How it is flawed, where it
        needs work and what can be done to improve it. Great! If you’re professor
        is experienced enough, he definitely receives invitation for National and
        International Conferences. These are topic oriented and their purpose is
        only to gather scholars and researchers under one roof, and “discuss”
        current technological status. That’s it. You need not achieve ground
        breaking results or develop models or algorithms no one has even seen or
        some shit. Only addressing problem statements, their assumptions and
        conclusions, and what can be done to solve them is more than enough. For
        more details on this, click here. (complete by April end of 6th Semester)
      </p>
      <p> j. Submit your work for two to three reports in International conferences
        like this with DOI numbers are you’re academic profile is set for master’s
        application. (If the conference is in The first week of January 2021, they
        usually accept Abstracts and Paper by June end of 2021. After 2 to 3
        months from Jan, you’ll finally get your DOI link) Carry on with your
        research (if time permits), and one can also end up with a good research
        journal in their name, in U.G!</p>

    <h4 class="drop_down">GRE and IELTS</h4>
    <div class="content active">
      <p>GRE preparation timeline is highly subjective. Still here’s a brief
        dissection of the preparation process. It can be cleared in 4 months or
        even less if studied with dedication. Some people may even require 6 or
        more months depending on their retaining capacity.</p>
      <p> There are ONLY two
        parts. English. Mathematics.</p>
      <ol type="1"> <span>Paper Pattern:-</span>
        <li type="1"> Writing (1hour)</li>
        <li type="1"> Verbal
          Reasoning (30 minutes)</li>
        <li type="1"> Quantitative Reasoning (35 minutes)</li>
        <li type="1">Verbal

        <li type="1">
          Verbal/Quantitative (30/35 minutes)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Out of the last 5 sections, 4 are
        fixed. Remaining one can be either Quantitative or Verbal and this is not scored.
        However,there is no way of knowing whether the 2nd or 3rd of 4th or 5th or
        6th section is the special one. In the personal experience of many candidates,
        it will be either extremely easy or extremely difficult, but this is not
        always true. So it is important to approach each section with EQUAL vigor
        and attention.
