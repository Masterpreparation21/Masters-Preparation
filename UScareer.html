    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The master’s program in US is a 3 to4 semester program. In most of the
      degrees, a minimum criterion of 30 credits is required to complete your
      program. This can be achieved even in 3 semesters, cutting the tuition
      fees substantially. (More details on this in subsequent pages).
    </p>

    <p>
      Admission process for fall usually begins in November or December of its
      previous year and ends by January or Feb of that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following is an overview, listing prerequisites of the entire application
      process for universities in the United States

      <p>For students solely interested in cracking interviews and entering the job market in US, it is essential to
        understand what the interviewers
        “EXPECT” during the hiring process. Following information is subjective, and drafted through personal experience
        from people either interning
        or having a full time job, after completing their master’s in US</p>
      <p>1. WORK EXPERIENCE is important</p>
      <p>Statistically speaking, if you don’t have a full time work experience (that is pursue MS directly after
        completing
        UG), the chances of even getting
        your job application notices reduces by 50 to 60%. </p>
      <p>Even after getting picked and called for an interview, you’ll be competing against someone who has 2 to 3 years
        of
        job relevant experience either
        in their home country or US. You WILL be compared against them, and chances of being selected further drops by
        60%.
      </p>
      <p>Hence, work experience IS important. </p>
      <p>2. DEPTH of KNOWLEDGE is important</p>
      <p>The job interviews in US are more of a thorough discussion over your resume and question answer session on the
        topics of your project, in contrast to
        back to back question asked on any topic.</p>
      <p>Thus it is necessary to have in depth knowledge of topics on all the projects, research work and internships
        you
        mention in your resume. They will first
        hear you out about what all you have done so far, and then dissect the material on a microscopic level. After
        testing your fundamental knowledge on the
        subjects you yourself presented to them, they may slightly change the problem statement. It will be obviously be
        in
        the same domain, but slightly changed,
        and will ask you to solve it based on skills you have. This is to test your applicative skills of solving
        problems
        based on knowledge you acquired during UG and MS.</p>
      <p>WHY IS ALL THIS IMPORTANT FOR SOMEONE STILL IN THEIR UG? Good question.</p>
      <p>Knowing this gives a sense of awareness of what to do. Also now you consciously walk the extra mile while doing
        any
        internships or projects, which are the
        building block of your resume</p>
      <p>Things to do during Internships</p>
      <p>A. TALK</p>
      <p>Yeah! It is very important to talk to people during internships. More or less everyone lands an internship in
        UG
        through personal contacts and favors, and they
        limit their reach only in one department under one person. </p>
      <p>If it is a manufacturing industry, roam around the plant. Explore all departments of the firm. The material
        procurement folks, the processing guys, packing and
        distribution people, RnD department, design team, senior management level, and anyone else working there.
        Achieve
        a
        total sense of the company site. Note it
        and report it. </p>
      <p>If it is service industry comprising IT, finance etc, chart the overall work flow of the firm. How
        responsibilities
        are distributed within the company, what
        skills are expected from them. This will provide insight of what more this is to learn in terms of language, DS
        Algo
        and ML Ai. It also makes you realize
        what salary you’ll get after doing all that, the lifestyle and whether you want to settle for that or not. </p>
      <p>This highlights your dedication of learning and the vigilance of being curious during the term you were with
        them.
      </p>
      <p>B. Score a project</p>
      <p>In India, vocational training is falsely labeled as “internship” and sold in campus interviews. The difference
        between the two lies in “applicative work”
        in the latter. Internship actually means working hours and completion of set targets. This is unfortunately not
        even
        offered in vocational training
        students do in their summer and winter breaks of UG. </p>
      <p>So its important you score some project, some work, some responsibility from your mentor during your
        internship.
        It
        doesn’t matter how small it is
        or how relevant it is, What matters is that you have something to say when someone asks, “what did you do in
        this
        internship”. The answer should
        be “I solved this..” or “I worked on this….” Instead of “I learnt this…”. No one is interested in what you
        learnt,
        but what did you do with
        “what you learnt is a charm to hear.</p>

    <h4 class="drop_down">GRE and IELTS</h3>
      <div class="dropdown_content active">
        <p>GRE preparation timeline is highly subjective. Still here’s a brief dissection of the preparation process. It
          can
          be cleared in 4 months or even less
          if studied with dedication. Some people may even require 6 or more months depending on their retaining
          capacity.
        </p>
        <p>There are ONLY two parts. English. Mathematics. </p>
        <p>Paper Pattern:-</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Writing (1hour)</li>
          <li>Verbal Reasoning (30 minutes)</li>
          <li>Quantitative Reasoning (35 minutes)</li>
          <li>Verbal Reasoning (30 minutes)</li>
          <li>Quantitative Reasoning (35 minutes)</li>
          <li>Verbal/Quantitative (30/35 minutes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Out of the last 5 sections, 4 are fixed. Remaining one can be either Quantitative or Verbal and this is not
          scored.
          However,there is no way of knowing whether the 2nd or 3rd of 4th or 5th or 6th section is the special one.
          In the personal experience of many candidates, it will be either extremely easy or extremely difficult, but
          this
          is
          not always true. So it is important to approach each section with EQUAL vigor and attention. </p>
        <h5 class="drop_down">A. Verbal</h5>
